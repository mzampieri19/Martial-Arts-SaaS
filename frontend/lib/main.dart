// Hi Guys this is Michael Im writing a few comments on the pages to keep track what page is which
// This is main.dart. Here we will have the landing page for the app. 
// From here the user will click log in or sign up which will take them to log_in.dart and sign_up.dart
// After they enter their details they will be taken to home.dart which is where the main page of the app is, with the nav bar. 
// From there they can go to profile.dart to see and edit their profile.

// For now I have linked all the pages together (very simply) so you can see how it works.

// Based on the sprint 1 planning doc:
// Grace works on main.dart and log_in.dart
// Jayden works on sign_up.dart 
// Michael works on home.dart
// Nancy works on profile.dart
